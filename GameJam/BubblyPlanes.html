    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
		Bubbly Planes is a fast-paced local split-screen multiplayer game where players take control of delicate yet agile paper planes, navigating through environments like a small bathroom, a regular bathroom, and a chaotic car wash.

		The challenge? Keep your plane in the air by managing speed and moisture levels while competing to earn the most points! Glide through soap bubbles, pop them for bonuses, and avoid hazards like bubble-shooting cannons, spinning car wash brushes, and even attacks from your opponent!

		With dynamic obstacles and interactive physics-based mechanics, Bubbly Planes is an exciting mix of strategy, skill, and pure airborne fun. Will you master the art of paper flight and claim victory?

		Let the bubbly battle begin!
