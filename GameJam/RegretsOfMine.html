    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Regrets of Mine is a 3D narrative-driven first-person experience about memory, loss, and the things we never truly leave behind.

		You return to a Victorian house you once called home. By finding different masks, you gain access to shift how the world reveals itself - paintings change, spaces distort, and hidden memories resurface. Each mask exposes a different layer of the past, asking you to confront relationships shaped by duty, absence, and silence.

		There is no combat. No rush. Progress comes from observation, reflection, and understanding what the house is trying to show you.

		This game is about facing regret - not to erase it, but to finally let it rest.
